# DIY DRONE 

## INDEX

## INTRODUCTION
This project surges of my curiosity and interest in UAV's. Nowdays medium/larges drones and RC Trnasmitters are too much expensive; and the componentes used in are away one click, so the idea of making a DIY drone isn't far from reality. 

In this repository I will explain part by part of some drone flight theory and electronics theory, drone assembly, coding and construction of RC transmitter. The content will be split in three parts: Drone, Drone Comunication and Transmitter Comunication.  

## PARTS LIST
For the drone you need:
* Drone Frame
* 4 Brushless motors AA2212
* 4 ESC of 30 Amps
* Flight Controller CC3D
* Arduino PRO Mini or any type of Arduino
* Lithium Polymer Battery 11.1V 
* 1 nrf24l01 

For the RC you need:
* 1 nrf24l01
* LM7805
* LD333V
* Arduino PRO Mini
* Gyroscope
* 2 Joysticks 
* 2 Switches
* Condersators
* Resistors
* 2 Pushbuttons
